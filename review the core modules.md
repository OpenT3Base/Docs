Core Enterprise Modules

    PLM: Product Lifecycle Management (ideation, engineering, BOM, changes)
    MRP: Material Requirements Planning (inventory, demand, purchasing)
    SCM: Supply Chain Management (suppliers, sourcing, procurement)
    MES: Manufacturing Execution System (shop floor, production, IoT)
    ERP: Enterprise Resource Planning (finance, HR, compliance, core business)
    Sales/Commerce: Omnichannel sales (web, POS, B2B/B2C, orders, pricing)
    Logistics: Shipping, fulfillment, warehouses, returns
    CRM: Customer Relationship Management (accounts, sales, support)

Platform & Enabling Modules

    BI: Business Intelligence (dashboards, analytics, reporting, AI insights)
    QMS: Quality Management System (process, product, compliance)
    IAM: Identity & Access Management (SSO, roles, security)
    PM: Project Management (tasks, milestones, teams)
    DMS: Document Management System (storage, workflow, e-signature)
    Mobile & IoT: Mobile apps, edge devices, IoT connectivity
    Localization & Internationalization: Globalization, language, currency, legal
    Community & Ecosystem: Plugins, developer portal, forums, open-source governance

Additional Considerations

You now cover the full digital thread:

    Idea → Product → Planning → Supply → Manufacturing → Sales → Shipping → Customer → Analytics → Continuous Improvement

You have:

    All major business, operational, and platform modules
    Mobile and IoT support for edge and shop floor integration
    Ecosystem & extensibility for community growth
    Internationalization for global reach

Optional/Niche Enhancements (if desired for future-proofing)

    AI/ML Module: Core AI services and workflow automation (may be part of BI or standalone)
    Marketplace/Plugins: For app store-like ecosystem (may merge with Community & Ecosystem)
    Industry-Specific Modules: E.g., Field Service, Healthcare, Construction, Education
    Compliance & Audit: Deep regulatory and audit trail tools
    DevOps & Deployment: CI/CD, monitoring, scalable cloud options (could be in Community)

Conclusion:
Your current plan covers all major enterprise systems and platform needs for a modern, global, open-source business suite.
If you need to address a specific industry or specialized workflow, you can add vertical modules as needed, but for a general-purpose suite, your design is comprehensive.
